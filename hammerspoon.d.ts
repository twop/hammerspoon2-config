/**
 * Bridge type for working with images in JavaScript
HSImage provides a comprehensive API for loading, manipulating, and saving images.
It supports various image sources including files, system icons, app bundles, and URLs.
## Loading Images
```javascript
// Load from file
const img = HSImage.fromPath("/path/to/image.png")

// Load system image
const icon = HSImage.fromName("NSComputer")

// Load app icon
const appIcon = HSImage.fromAppBundle("com.apple.Safari")

HSImage.fromURL("https://example.com/image.png")
    .then(image => console.log("Image loaded:", image.size))
    .catch(err => console.error("Failed to load image:", err))

// Or with async/await
const image = await HSImage.fromURL("https://example.com/image.png")
```
## Image Manipulation
```javascript
const img = HSImage.fromPath("/path/to/image.png")

// Get size
const size = img.size  // Returns HSSize

// Resize image (mutates in place)
img.size = HSSize(100, 100)

// Crop image
const cropped = img.croppedCopy(HSRect(10, 10, 50, 50))

// Save to file
img.saveToFile("/path/to/output.png")

## Loading Video
Each entry may be a local file path (`~` is expanded) or a remote URL string. Multiple
entries are queued and play back to back, in order.

// A single local file
const clip = HSVideo.fromURLs(["~/Movies/clip.mp4"])

// A playlist mixing a local file and a remote stream
const playlist = HSVideo.fromURLs(["~/Movies/intro.mp4", "https://example.com/video.mp4"])

## Playback Control
```javascript
const clip = HSVideo.fromURLs(["~/Movies/clip.mp4"])
clip.volume = 0.5
clip.loop(true)
clip.play()
// ... later ...
clip.seek(30)
clip.pause()
```
## Looping

single URL. Calling `loop(true)` on a multi-URL playlist has no effect (the playlist just
plays through once) and logs a warning.

     * Load a Spoon - a packaged, reusable piece of configuration - by name, from the
`Spoons` directory inside your config directory. A Spoon must contain a well-formed
`spoon.json` (with non-empty `name`, `author`, `version`, and `description` fields)
and an `init.js`, or loading fails with an exception. `init.js` is loaded through the
same `require()` used for the rest of your config, so it can itself `require()`
further files from within the Spoon's own directory using relative paths. On success,
the Spoon's `module.exports` is also stored on `hs.spoons` under its name, so other
code can reach an already-loaded Spoon without needing to call `loadSpoon()` again.
`init.js` must set `module.exports` to an object (or a function, since functions are
objects too) - loading fails with an exception otherwise. Its `author`, `description`,
and `version` properties are then set from `spoon.json`, overwriting any of the same
name the Spoon's own `init.js` set, so that information is always present and always
reflects what's on disk. If the resulting object has an `init()` method, it's called
automatically (with `this` bound to the object) before `loadSpoon()` returns - matching
Hammerspoon 1's behavior. An exception thrown from `init()` fails the load: nothing is
stored on `hs.spoons`, and `loadSpoon()` throws. Unlike `init.js` itself (which
`require()` only ever evaluates once), `init()` runs again on every `loadSpoon()` call
for the same Spoon, since the same cached object is returned each time - write it to be
safe to call more than once, or do one-time setup at `init.js`'s top level instead.

        })

})
```
## Advertising a service
```js
hs.bonjour.advertise('My Web Server', '_http._tcp.', 8080, ev => {
    if (ev === 'published') console.log('Now advertising!')
    else if (ev === 'error') console.error('Advertising failed')
})
// Later, to stop:
hs.bonjour.stopAdvertising('My Web Server', '_http._tcp.')

/**
 * # hs.canvas
**A low-level, absolutely-positioned drawing surface**
`hs.canvas` mirrors v1 Hammerspoon's `hs.canvas` module: elements are plain JS
objects (mirroring v1's Lua tables) describing shapes (`rectangle`, `circle`,
`oval`, `text`) with a `fill`/`stroke`/`strokeAndFill`/`clip`/`build`/`skip` action
pipeline. This is a different tool from `hs.ui`, which is a SwiftUI stack/layout
builder for app-like interfaces -- reach for `hs.canvas` when you need absolute
positioning, clipped/composited shapes, or direct window-level/Spaces control.
## Coordinate systems -- read this before positioning elements
A canvas's **window position** (`create({x, y, w, h})`, and any later `x`/`y` you
`y = 0` is the *bottom* of the screen, and `y` increases upward. This matches
`hs.ui.window`.
But **element content** positioned *inside* a canvas -- every `frame`, `center`, and
`y = 0` is the *top* of the canvas, and `y` increases downward. These two coordinate
senses are independent of each other and easy to conflate, especially when a script
computes an element's position from the same screen geometry it used for the
window's own placement. If a shape appears vertically mirrored from where you
expect, this mismatch is the first thing to check.
## Example: a rounded screen corner overlay
```javascript
const radius = 12
const corner = hs.canvas.create({x: 0, y: 0, w: radius, h: radius})
corner.appendElements([
    { action: "build", type: "rectangle" },
    { action: "clip", type: "circle", center: {x: radius, y: radius}, radius: radius, reversePath: true },
    { action: "fill", type: "rectangle", fillColor: { alpha: 1 } },
    { type: "resetClip" }
])
corner.levelValue(hs.canvas.windowLevels.screenSaver + 1)
corner.behavior("canJoinAllSpaces")
corner.show()
```

/**
 * # hs.chooser
**A Spotlight-style chooser for presenting options to the user**
`hs.chooser` lets you show a floating search panel that users can type into to filter and
select from a list of items. It's ideal for launchers, emoji pickers, command palettes, and
any interface where you want fast, keyboard-driven selection.
## Quick Start
```javascript
const chooser = hs.chooser.create()

chooser.setChoices([
    { text: "Open Safari", subText: "Web browser", action: "safari" },
    { text: "Open Terminal", subText: "Command line", action: "terminal" }
])

chooser.onSelect = (item) => {
    if (item) console.log("Selected: " + item.text + " (" + item.action + ")")
}

chooser.show()
```
## Dynamic Choices
```javascript
const allApps = hs.application.runningApplications()

chooser.setChoices((query) => {
    const q = query.toLowerCase()
    return allApps
        .filter(a => a.title.toLowerCase().includes(q))
        .map(a => ({ text: a.title, subText: a.bundleID }))
})
```
## Async Choices (with debounce)
```javascript
let debounceTimer = null
let cachedResults = []

chooser.setChoices(() => cachedResults)

chooser.onQueryChange = (query) => {
    if (debounceTimer) debounceTimer.invalidate()
    debounceTimer = hs.timer.doAfter(0.05, () => {
        fetchFromAPI(query).then(results => {
            cachedResults = results
            chooser.refreshChoices()
        })
    })
}
```
 */
declare namespace hs.chooser {
    /**
     * Create a new chooser.

     */
    function create(): HSChooser;

}

/**
 * A keyboard-driven floating chooser panel.
Create via `hs.chooser.create()`. Configure choices, set callbacks, then call `.show()`.
## Choice format
Each choice is a plain object with required `text` and optional `subText`, `image`, `valid`,
and `contextMenu` fields. All other fields are passed through to the `onSelect` callback unchanged.
The `contextMenu` array defines per-row right-click menu entries. Each entry is either
```javascript
{
  text: "Open Safari", subText: "com.apple.Safari",
  image: HSImage.fromAppBundle("com.apple.Safari"), valid: true, myData: 42,
  contextMenu: [
    { title: "Open", action: () => hs.urlevent.openURL("https://apple.com") },
    { type: "divider" },
    { title: "Copy bundle ID", action: () => hs.pasteboard.writeString("com.apple.Safari") }

/**
 * Module for filesystem operations.
`hs.fs` provides a comprehensive set of filesystem operations covering file
I/O, directory management, path manipulation, metadata access, symbolic
links, Finder tags, and macOS-specific features like file bookmarks and
Uniform Type Identifiers.
It replaces both Hammerspoon v1's `hs.fs` module and the functionality that
was previously available through Lua's built-in `io` and `file` modules.
## Reading and writing files
```javascript
const contents = hs.fs.read("/etc/hosts");           // entire file
const chunk    = hs.fs.read("/etc/hosts", 100, 50);  // 50 bytes from offset 100

hs.fs.readLines("/etc/hosts", function(line) {
    console.log(line);
    return true; // return false to stop early
});

hs.fs.write("/tmp/hello.txt", "Hello, world!\n");
hs.fs.append("/tmp/hello.txt", "More content\n");
```
## Directory operations
```javascript
hs.fs.mkdir("~/Projects/new-thing");

const files = hs.fs.list("~/Documents");
const all   = hs.fs.listRecursive("~/Documents");
```
## Path utilities
```javascript
const abs  = hs.fs.pathToAbsolute("~/Library");
const tmp  = hs.fs.temporaryDirectory();
const home = hs.fs.homeDirectory();
```
## Metadata
```javascript
const info = hs.fs.attributes("/etc/hosts");
// { size: 1234, type: "file", permissions: 420,
//   ownerID: 0, groupID: 0,
//   creationDate: 1700000000.0, modificationDate: 1700001000.0 }

## Async callback

/**
 * Run AppleScript and OSA JavaScript from Hammerspoon scripts.
Script execution is isolated in a separate XPC helper process
(`HammerspoonOSAScriptHelper`). If a script crashes or deadlocks, only the
helper is affected — the main app remains stable and the next call
reconnects automatically.
## Async API (Promise-based)
Every async function returns a `Promise` that **always resolves** (never rejects)
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `success` | `Boolean` | `true` if the script ran without error |
| `result` | `any` | Parsed return value of the script, or `null` on failure |
| `raw` | `String` | Raw string representation of the result, or the error message on failure |
## Sync API
The `*Sync` variants block until the script completes and return the same
`{ success, result, raw }` object directly.  Use these only when a Promise
chain is impractical; they block the JS thread for the duration of the call.
The `result` field is typed based on what the script returned: strings,
numbers, booleans, lists, and records are all mapped to their JavaScript
equivalents. `null` is used for AppleScript's `missing value` and for any
failure case.
## Examples
**Return a string (async):**
```javascript
hs.osascript.applescript('return "hello"')
  .then(r => console.log(r.result));  // "hello"
```
**Return a string (sync):**
```javascript
const r = hs.osascript.applescriptSync('return "hello"');
console.log(r.result);  // "hello"
```
**Interact with an application:**
```javascript
hs.osascript.applescript('tell application "Finder" to get name of home')
  .then(r => console.log(r.result));  // e.g. "cmsj"
```
**Handle errors (the Promise never rejects — check `success`):**
```javascript
hs.osascript.applescript('this is not valid')
  .then(r => {
    if (!r.success) console.log("Error:", r.raw);
  });
```
**OSA JavaScript:**
```javascript
hs.osascript.javascript('Application("Finder").name()')
  .then(r => console.log(r.result));  // "Finder"
```
**Run a script from a file:**
```javascript
hs.osascript.applescriptFromFile('/Users/me/scripts/notify.applescript')

/**
 * Module for interacting with the macOS pasteboard (clipboard)
The macOS pasteboard is "rich" — a single clipboard operation can carry multiple representations
of the same content for different applications to consume. For example, text copied from a web
browser may carry plain text, HTML, and RTF representations simultaneously.
## Basic Usage
```js
// Read and write plain text
const text = hs.pasteboard.readString()
hs.pasteboard.writeString("Hello from Hammerspoon!")

// Check what types are currently on the pasteboard
const available = hs.pasteboard.types()

// Write multiple representations at once
hs.pasteboard.writeObjects({
    "public.utf8-plain-text": "Hello",
    "public.html": "<b>Hello</b>"
})

// Watch for pasteboard changes
const handler = (changeCount) => {
    console.log("Pasteboard changed, count:", changeCount)
    console.log("New text:", hs.pasteboard.readString())
}
hs.pasteboard.on("change", handler)
// Later: hs.pasteboard.off("change", handler)
```
## Pasteboard Conventions (nspasteboard.org)
macOS has no built-in notification API for transient or confidential clipboard content, so a
community convention has emerged (see [nspasteboard.org](https://nspasteboard.org)) around four
`org.nspasteboard.*` UTI marker types. These markers carry no payload — their mere presence on
the pasteboard signals intent to other applications.
### Standard marker UTIs
| UTI | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `org.nspasteboard.TransientType` | Content is temporary; it will be removed or overwritten shortly. Clipboard historians should **not** record this change. |
| `org.nspasteboard.ConcealedType` | Content is sensitive (e.g. a password). Historians should obfuscate it if displayed and ideally encrypt it if stored. |
| `org.nspasteboard.AutoGeneratedType` | Content was placed by an application without any user Copy action. Historians should generally skip recording it. |
| `org.nspasteboard.source` | The bundle identifier of the application that placed the content. Use an empty string when the source is unknown. |
### Legacy proprietary markers
Several apps defined their own markers before the `org.nspasteboard.*` standard existed.
| UTI | Application |
|-----|-------------|
| `de.petermaurer.TransientPasteboardType` | TextExpander, Butler |
| `com.typeit4me.clipping` | TypeIt4Me |
| `Pasteboard generator type` | Typinator |
| `com.agilebits.onepassword` | 1Password (confidential) |
| `com.apple.is-remote-clipboard` | macOS (remote content) |
### For scripts that write to the pasteboard
If your script temporarily commandeers the pasteboard (e.g. to trigger a paste), add
```js
hs.pasteboard.writeObjects({
    "public.utf8-plain-text": "temporary value",
    "org.nspasteboard.TransientType": ""
})
```
```js
hs.pasteboard.writeObjects({
    "public.utf8-plain-text": "s3cr3t!",
    "org.nspasteboard.ConcealedType": ""
})
```
### For scripts that monitor the pasteboard
If you are building a clipboard history tool with `on`, skip or obfuscate entries that
```js
const SKIP_TYPES = [
    "org.nspasteboard.TransientType",
    "org.nspasteboard.AutoGeneratedType",
    "de.petermaurer.TransientPasteboardType",
    "com.typeit4me.clipping",
    "Pasteboard generator type",
]
const CONCEAL_TYPES = [
    "org.nspasteboard.ConcealedType",
    "com.agilebits.onepassword",
]

hs.pasteboard.on("change", (changeCount) => {
    const types = hs.pasteboard.types()
    if (SKIP_TYPES.some(t => types.includes(t))) return        // ignore transient
    const conceal = CONCEAL_TYPES.some(t => types.includes(t)) // handle sensitively
    // … record or display the pasteboard contents …
})
```

/**
 * Query the macOS Spotlight metadata database.
`hs.spotlight` wraps `NSMetadataQuery` to let you search for files and other
metadata objects indexed by Spotlight. Queries use `NSPredicate` syntax with
`kMDItem*` attribute keys (see `hs.spotlight.attribute` for common shortcuts).
## Quick start
```js
// Find all PDFs in the home directory and log their paths
const q = hs.spotlight.create()

 .setScopes([hs.spotlight.scope.home])
 .setCallback((event) => {

         )
         q.stop()
     }
 })
 .start()
```
## One-shot search convenience
```js
const q = hs.spotlight.search(
    "kMDItemDisplayName BEGINSWITH 'Invoice'",
    (event) => {
        if (event === 'didFinish') {
            console.log('Found ' + q.count + ' invoices')
            q.stop()
        }
    }
)
```
## Grouping results by attribute
```js
const q = hs.spotlight.create()
q.setQuery("kMDItemContentTypeTree == 'public.image'")
 .setScopes([hs.spotlight.scope.home])
 .setGroupingAttributes([hs.spotlight.attribute.kind])
 .setCallback((event) => {

         )
         q.stop()
     }
 })
 .start()
```
## Monitoring for live changes
```js
// Keep the query running to receive live-update events
const q = hs.spotlight.create()
q.setQuery("kMDItemContentType == 'com.apple.application-bundle'")
 .setScopes(['/Applications'])
 .setCallback((event, update) => {

Language identifiers use BCP-47 format (e.g. `"en"`, `"fr"`, `"zh-Hans"`).
Call `hs.translation.supportedLanguages()` to list every language the framework
recognises, and `hs.translation.status()` to check whether a specific pair is
installed and ready for offline use.
Language packs are downloaded through
**System Settings → General → Language & Region → Translation Languages**.
`hs.translation` cannot trigger downloads programmatically; `session()` returns
`null` when the requested pair is not yet installed.
## Quick start
```js
hs.translation.status("en", "fr").then(s => {
    if (s === "installed") {
        const session = hs.translation.session("en", "fr")
        session.translate("Good morning").then(r => console.log(r))
    } else {
        console.log("Install en→fr in System Settings → Language & Region → Translation Languages")
    }
})
```

/**
 * # hs.ui
**Create custom user interfaces, alerts, dialogs, and file pickers**
The `hs.ui` module provides a set of tools for creating custom user interfaces
in Hammerspoon with SwiftUI-like declarative syntax.
## Key Features
then call `.replaceWithColor()` or `.replaceWithHex()` on it from any callback to re-render the canvas automatically
then call `.set()` on it to update the displayed content live
to swap the image without rebuilding the window
## Basic Examples
### Simple Alert
```javascript
hs.ui.alert("Task completed!")
    .duration(3)
    .show();
```
### Dialog with Buttons
```javascript
hs.ui.dialog("Save changes?")
    .informativeText("Your document has unsaved changes.")
    .buttons(["Save", "Don't Save", "Cancel"])
    .onButton((index) => {
        if (index === 0) console.log("Saving...");
    })
    .show();
```
### Text Input Prompt
```javascript
hs.ui.textPrompt("Enter your name")
    .defaultText("John Doe")
    .onButton((buttonIndex, text) => {
        console.log("User entered: " + text);
    })
    .show();
```
### File Picker
```javascript
hs.ui.filePicker()
    .message("Choose a file")
    .allowedFileTypes(["txt", "md"])
    .onSelection((path) => {
        if (path) console.log("Selected: " + path);
    })
    .show();
```
### Custom Window
```javascript
hs.ui.window({x: 100, y: 100, w: 300, h: 200})
    .vstack()
        .spacing(10)
        .padding(20)
        .text("Hello, World!")
            .font(HSFont.title())
            .foregroundColor("#FFFFFF")
        .rectangle()
            .fill("#4A90E2")
            .cornerRadius(10)
            .frame({w: "100%", h: 60})
    .end()
    .backgroundColor("#2C3E50")
    .show();
```
### Reactive Color on Hover
```javascript
// Create a mutable color, then mutate it inside the hover callback
const btnColor = HSColor.hex("#4A90E2");

hs.ui.window({x: 100, y: 100, w: 160, h: 60})
    .rectangle()
        .fill(btnColor)
        .cornerRadius(8)
        .frame({w: "100%", h: "100%"})
        .onHover((isHovered) => {
            btnColor.replaceWithHex(isHovered ? "#E24A4A" : "#4A90E2");
        })
    .show();
```
### Reactive Text on Hover
```javascript
// Create a mutable string, then mutate it inside the hover callback
const label = hs.ui.string("Move your mouse here");

hs.ui.window({x: 100, y: 200, w: 220, h: 50})
    .text(label)
        .font(HSFont.body())
        .foregroundColor("#FFFFFF")
        .onHover((isHovered) => {
            label.set(isHovered ? "You're hovering!" : "Move your mouse here");
        })
    .show();
```
### Reactive Image on Click
```javascript
// Toggle between two system icons on each click
const icon = HSImage.fromName("NSStatusAvailable");

hs.ui.window({x: 100, y: 300, w: 80, h: 80})
    .image(icon)
        .resizable()
        .aspectRatio("fit")
        .frame({w: 64, h: 64})
        .onClick(() => {
            const next = (icon.name === "NSStatusAvailable")
                ? HSImage.fromName("NSStatusUnavailable")
                : HSImage.fromName("NSStatusAvailable");
            icon.replaceWithImage(next);
        })
    .show();
```
## Complete Example: Status Dashboard
Here's a more complex example showing how to build an interactive status dashboard
```javascript
// Create a status dashboard window
const statusWindow = hs.ui.window({x: 100, y: 100, w: 400, h: 500})
    .vstack()
        .spacing(15)
        .padding(20)

        // Header
        .text("System Status Dashboard")
            .font(HSFont.largeTitle())
            .foregroundColor("#FFFFFF")

        // Status cards
        .hstack()
            .spacing(10)
            .vstack()
                .spacing(5)
                .rectangle()
                    .fill("#4CAF50")
                    .cornerRadius(8)
                    .frame({w: 180, h: 100})
                .text("CPU: 45%")
                    .font(HSFont.headline())
                    .foregroundColor("#FFFFFF")
            .end()
            .vstack()
                .spacing(5)
                .rectangle()
                    .fill("#2196F3")
                    .cornerRadius(8)
                    .frame({w: 180, h: 100})
                .text("Memory: 8.2GB")
                    .font(HSFont.headline())
                    .foregroundColor("#FFFFFF")
            .end()
        .end()

        // Activity indicator with image
        .hstack()
            .spacing(10)
            .image(HSImage.fromName("NSComputer"))
                .resizable()
                .aspectRatio("fit")
                .frame({w: 64, h: 64})
            .vstack()
                .text("System Running")
                    .font(HSFont.title())
                .text("All services operational")
                    .font(HSFont.caption())
                    .foregroundColor("#A0A0A0")
            .end()
        .end()

        // Circle status indicators
        .hstack()
            .spacing(20)
            .circle()
                .fill("#4CAF50")
                .frame({w: 30, h: 30})
            .circle()
                .fill("#FFC107")
                .frame({w: 30, h: 30})
            .circle()
                .fill("#F44336")
                .frame({w: 30, h: 30})
        .end()
    .end()
    .backgroundColor("#2C3E50");

// Show the dashboard
statusWindow.show();

// Later, interact with dialogs
hs.ui.dialog("Shutdown system?")
    .informativeText("This will close all applications.")
    .buttons(["Shutdown", "Cancel"])
    .onButton((index) => {
        if (index === 0) {
            hs.ui.alert("Shutting down...")
                .duration(3)
                .show();
        }
    })
    .show();
```
## Complete Example: Reactive Hover Card
Demonstrates reactive colors and reactive text together — a single `.onHover()`
```javascript
const cardColor = HSColor.hex("#3498DB");
const cardLabel = hs.ui.string("Hover the card");

hs.ui.window({x: 100, y: 100, w: 220, h: 120})
    .vstack()
        .spacing(12)
        .padding(16)
        .rectangle()
            .fill(cardColor)
            .cornerRadius(10)
            .frame({w: "100%", h: 60})
            .onHover((isHovered) => {
                cardColor.replaceWithHex(isHovered ? "#E74C3C" : "#3498DB");
                cardLabel.set(isHovered ? "You found it!" : "Hover the card");
            })
        .text(cardLabel)
            .font(HSFont.headline())
            .foregroundColor("#FFFFFF")
    .end()
    .backgroundColor("#1A252F")
    .show();
```

/**
 * # HSUIWindow
**A custom window with declarative UI building**
`HSUIWindow` allows you to create custom windows with a SwiftUI-like
declarative syntax. Build interfaces using shapes, text, images, and layout containers.
** Note: ** Clicking the macOS close button only **hides** the window (firing the `onHide()`
callback, if you have one configured) — it does not destroy the window while you hold a reference to it in
JavaScript. Call `destroy()` explicitly (for example from within an `onHide()` handler)
if you want to release it. See `onShow()`, `onHide()`, and `onDestroy()` below for the
full set of lifecycle callbacks.
## Building UI Elements

/**
 * # hs.ui.webview
**A web browser element for embedding in `hs.ui.window` layouts**
Available on macOS 26.0 or later, `hs.ui.webview()` creates a web browser element backed
by a SwiftUI `WebView` and `WebPage`. Embed it in any `hs.ui.window` using
`.webview(element)` — it fills the available space and can sit alongside other elements in
stacks.
```javascript
const wv = hs.ui.webview()
    .toolbar(["back", "forward", "reload", "url"])
    .loadURL("https://apple.com")

hs.ui.window({x: 100, y: 100, w: 1024, h: 768})
    .titled(true)
    .closable(true)
    .allowResize(true)
    .level("normal")
    .webview(wv)
    .show()
```
Because `wv` is a regular JavaScript object you can keep a reference and call navigation
```javascript
wv.loadURL("https://google.com")
wv.goBack()
```
## Custom Toolbar Example
```javascript
const wv = hs.ui.webview()
    .toolbar([
        "back", "forward", "reload", "url",
        {title: "Home", systemImage: "house", callback: () => wv.loadURL("https://apple.com")},
        {title: "Reload HS", callback: () => hs.reload()}
    ])
    .loadURL("https://apple.com")

hs.ui.window({x: 100, y: 100, w: 1024, h: 768})
    .webview(wv)
    .show()
```
## Full Example with Callbacks
```javascript
const wv = hs.ui.webview()
    .toolbar(["back", "forward", "reload", "url"])
    .inspectable(true)
    .onNavigate((url) => console.log("Navigated to: " + url))
    .onTitleChange((title) => console.log("Title: " + title))
    .onLoadChange((loading, url, title, progress) => {
        if (!loading) console.log("Page ready: " + url)
    })
    .loadURL("https://apple.com")

hs.ui.window({x: 100, y: 100, w: 1024, h: 768})
    .webview(wv)
    .show()
```
## Navigation Policy Example
```javascript
const wv = hs.ui.webview()
    .toolbar(["back", "forward", "reload", "url"])
    .onNavigationDecision((url) => {
        return !url.includes("evil.com")
    })
    .loadURL("https://apple.com")

hs.ui.window({x: 100, y: 100, w: 1024, h: 768})
    .webview(wv)
    .show()
```
## JavaScript Evaluation Example
```javascript
const wv = hs.ui.webview().loadURL("https://apple.com")
hs.ui.window({x: 100, y: 100, w: 1024, h: 768}).webview(wv).show()

// Fire and forget
wv.execJS("document.body.style.backgroundColor = 'lightyellow'")

// With result (note the JS method name is evalJSResult)
wv.evalJSResult("document.title", (result, error) => {
    if (error) { console.log("Error: " + error) }
    else { console.log("Title: " + result) }
})
```

The module responds to `hammerspoon2://` URLs and, when Hammerspoon 2 is
configured as the system default handler, also to `http://`, `https://`,
and `mailto:` URLs.
## Responding to custom hammerspoon2:// events
URLs take the form `hammerspoon2://eventName?key=value&key2=value2`.
The host component (`eventName`) selects the registered callback.

Set `hs.urlevent.httpCallback` (or `mailtoCallback`) to a function.

relevant scheme — see `setDefaultHandler(_:_:)`.
